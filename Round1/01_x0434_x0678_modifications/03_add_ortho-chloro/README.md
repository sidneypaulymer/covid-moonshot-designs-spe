# Objective

I wasn't going to even try this step, but something in the back of my mind told me to do it.
Previously, for SPE_0048 thru SPE_0071, I had added a fluorine atom to the ring system at
the ortho position. When I was setting up those simulations, I did a quick look to see what
the compounds would look like with a chlorine instead of a fluorine. Based on that inspection
I decided that the chlorine atom wouldn't fit in the pocket. But, as I was getting ready to
move on to the linkers, I had that thought I mentioned earlier. I'm glad I ran these
simulations because base on these results, chlorine could very well fit in this tight spot
and also provide a halogen bonding interaction with HIS163 carbonyl oxygen.

# Results

I created molecules for only three of the candidates. I am not going to create chloro-
compounds for all analogous fluoro- compounds but at least a small subset should be
synthesized and tested.

# Update

I changed my mind, I am going to build and submit structures for all twenty-four fluoro-
compounds previously submitted.
