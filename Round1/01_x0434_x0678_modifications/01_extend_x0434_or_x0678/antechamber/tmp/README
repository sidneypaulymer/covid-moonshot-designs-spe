# I ran a simple test to see which format is better for retaining bonding information, mol2 or prepc.

mol2 was able to retain the bonding information contained in the original sdf and maintained through
antechamber. When I set the output format from antechamber to mol2, and loaded that mol2 file into
tleap followed by saving an .off file, the resulting .off file contained the bonding information
from the beginning. However, when I saved the output from antechamber in prepc format and loaded
that prepc file into tleap and save the .off file, all bonds were listed as single bonds. So,
I will move forward saving the output of antechamber in mol2 rather than prepc. The only major 
change this requires is to issue the tleap load commands as such:

 > $id = loadmol2 .mol2

vs.

 > loadamberprep .mol2

This is not hard to accommadate.

# one other downstream consideration: when I save a mol2 file from tleap, whether it was read in
from the .off or from the original .mol2 file containing the connectivity information, the saved
mol2 file doesn't include connectivity information (it just shows all bonds as single bonds).
I can rest assured that the dynamics of an MD simulation will still be correct, because the 
connectivity information is retained in the .off file. I just have to remember that the files
output with all single bond information are not representative of the data files used to generate
the dynamics.
