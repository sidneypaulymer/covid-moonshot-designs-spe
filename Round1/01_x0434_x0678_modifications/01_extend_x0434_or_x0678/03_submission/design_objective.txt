# Design Objective

The S1' binding pocket is an intriguing region of the Mpro enzyme to target. In the fragment screen,
many fragments bound in this location, with a hydrogen bond between the ligand and the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163.
There are three examples of fragments with a 3-pyridine moiety (x0107, x0434, and x0678) and an
additional closely related fragment with a pyrimidine (x0995). The pattern is obsured a little bit
with other functional groups (i.e. x0426 and x0540 with 4-pyridine, and x0967 with a phenol)
distracting from the 3-pyridine motif. For example, the 4-pyridine fragments could be useful except that 
the side groups extend into the solvent, making the 3-pyridine the preferred binding motif. x0995
presents an example fragment with an aniline-NH2 group in a beneficial location, a highly polar
region where the N-terminal SER1 from chain B interacts with ASP142 and the backbone of PHE140.
Also, x1093 offers an example of a larger ring system for increasing the surface contact area
and the potential for additional polar and/or hydrogen bonding interactions to further increase the
affinity of a piece of the drug molecule at this region of the binding pocket.

Another interesting feature of this fragment screen is the similarity of binding pose between x0678
and x0434. The 3-pyridine side of the molecules are exactly the same and bind almost identically to
the protein. The opposite side of the molecules differ, with each offering advantages or disadvantages
for further exploration. Therefore, I am proposing a set of compounds based on the x0434 and x0678
fragments with varying extensions to the 3-pyridine motif. These compounds all maintain the hydrogen
bond acceptor with the epsilon nitrogen of HIS163 and incorporate a nitrogen, either exocyclic as
demonstrated with x0995 or incorporated into larger 6+5 or 6+6 bicyclic heteroaromatic rings, to
interact with the N-terminus of chain B. These compounds offer varying protonation states and angles
for interacting with this key region of the enzyme.
