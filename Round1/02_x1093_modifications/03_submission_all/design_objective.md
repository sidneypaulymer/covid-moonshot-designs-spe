# Design Objective: explore modifications to x1093 to increase affinity in S1 binding pocket

In a previous submission, SID-ELM-b65, I proposed adding a fluoro- substituent ortho to
the attachment point of the pyridine ring of x0434 and x0678. I am proposing a similar
modification to the 7-azaindole moiety of fragment x1093. In addition to proposing a
fluoro- substituent at the ortho position to the attachment point of the 7-azaindole ring,
I am also proposing a chloro- substituent at the same location. I am also proposing 
some nitrogen replacements in the 7-azaindole ring to modulate electronic interactions
with the binding pocket, slightly adjust angles for h-bonding interactions, and/or provide
additional polar interactions with nearby polar side chains, e.g. ASN142. 

Finally, I am also proposing changing the linker to a carbamate analogous to x0434. The
attached PDB file contains QM/MM energy minimized structures for all 18 of these candidates
along with the dimer of the Mpro enzyme to see how these ligands interact with the SER1
N-terminal ammonium group.
