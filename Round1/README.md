# Round 1 Objective

The primary objective for this first round of designs is to establish the S1 site (binds Q 
in natural substrate) with as high affinity moieties as possible, upfront, then build
off that motif to add a warhead to covalently target CYS145. The preliminary steps to
accomplishing this objective include identifying the fragments which bind in the S1 site,
identifying commonalities between those fragments, and merging/crossing the fragments to
create the set of possible moieties which will bind to the S1 site with high affinity.

Once this preliminary set of moieties is generated, we will extend the moieties as seem
reasonable based on interaction sites in the protein, this includes adding halogens for
increased recognition and potential halogen binding interactions. Next, we will modify 
the linker regions of the initial candidates in preparation for attaching the warhead.
Several linkers will be persued to investigate geometries that are necessary for
engagement with the CYS145 thiol group.

The intent is to generate an exhaustive space of candidates for virtual screening in order
to identify the most likely candidates to move forward in subsequent rounds.
