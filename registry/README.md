# Notes on registry

Here are the files that I use to maintain my registry for this project. The primary
file, the one which I consider the 'source of all truth' is `registry.dwar`, a file
in DataWarrior format. From this file, I generate the .sdf and .can files. I keep
this registry up to date with any new ideas.
