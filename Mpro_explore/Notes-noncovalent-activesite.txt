# I don't necessarily want to follow the Diamond team, but they have lined things up quite nicely
# by focusing on this binding motif as the first priority. The interactions with :163 are hard
# to ignore. Next priority, focus on covalent binding to :145(CYS), then put those two fragments
# together.

## I increased the cutoff distance up to 5.0A and still got the same set of models
#

##
#1,5,8,21 all direct a electron-rich funtional group into a narrow, deep well
#5,21 both have cyano- groups and #1,8 both have fluoro- groups

#1 is particularly interesting because two of the functional groups have relevant 
interations in two separate locations in the active site. Well, #8 also engages
two locations in the active site as well. Perhaps merging both of these molecules
could engage three locations simultaneously....

The second location of #1 engages the same spot as the sulphonamide groups in #3,4,15

#8 isn't impressive to me. The fluoro- group is great, but #1 has the same interaction
but with a better scaffold. Ditch #8.

#7,14 both have thiophene groups that overlap with the aromatic systems of #1,5,8,21.
Initially, I was going to discard #7,14 but when I looked at space-filling models,
the sulphur of the thiophene groups reach almost to the same depths as the fluoro-
groups of #1,8

To summarize:
#1,8 with #5,21 with #7,14 all engage the same deep well in different ways
#3,4,15 overlap with the upper part of the previous six fragments and make a nice
replacement moiety for the top of this group of fragments.

# this leaves #0,6,17,19

#0 - the aromatic ring overlaps with the second group, but doesn't have a fluoro-
or cyano- group to engage the deep well sufficiently enough to warrant interest.
The top of the molecule may give evidence for a sulfonamide or other hydrogen-bonding
moiety in this region, but overall, the fragment doesn't give me much to work with

#6 - similar story to #0, ring overlaps with second group but the methyl substituent
is not as effective in my mind as a fluoro- or cyano- group in this region. The top
part of the fragment is completely exposed to solvent: doesn't give me much to work with

#17 - is a very small fragment but it engages in a good region (same as upper part of
fragment #0. Could be good to round out the far reaches of the active site

#19 - doesn't give much to work with
