# Design Objective: merge x0305 with x0434/x0678/x1093 extensions (w/ warhead)

I acknowledge a lot of inspiration for these compounds from the London Lab at
the Weizmann Institute, submission LON-WEI-b8d. However, I would like to add a
few things that I think are quite important. First, the stereocenter needs to
be specified as the particular enantiomer shown for each candidate molecule
in this submission. Second, I don't think the moieties off the acrylamide
warhead are beneficial, at least without 3D structures to support the
interactions made by those moieties. And third, the nitrile (or any other
substituent superimposing the nitrile from x0305) should be at the meta position.

## Other Notes:
I just called out the London Lab for not including 3D structures, then submitted
this set of candidates without supporting 3D structures. I note the irony, and
will work on adding structures at a later time in the comments.

# Submitted
Assigned submission number SID-ELM-433 on April 23, 2020

# Notes
I submitted this data set backwards from what I usually do. I submitted the
candidates _before_ I ran the simulations. I don't like to do that, because
the simulations will help triage bad candidates. But, I needed to get these
ideas out there, so I did it backward. I will then submit 3D structures in
the comments, as I promised in the 'Other Notes' section.
