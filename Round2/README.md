# Objective

The primary objective of Round 2 is to establish the second binding pocket,
demonstrated by such fragments as x0305, x0104, and x0395. These all have
either a fluoro- group or a nitrile group pointing into a deep well between
the two domains forming the binding site.

I would love to add x0104 to the growing molecule, but unfortunately the
angles of the aromatic rings between x0104 and x0434 are too non-coplanar
to be possible for x0104 to work. But x0305 is a great candidate, so I
will start there and built/replace as I go.
